**INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT**

Javascript is a versatile programming language commonly used for web development. It enables interactive and dynamic content on websites, handling actions like user input, updating page content, and communicating with servers.
In JavaScript, ```var```, ```let``` and ```const``` are used to declare variables.
- ```var``` was traditionally used for variable declaration but has some scope-related issues. it's globally or function-scoped, not block-scoped.
- ```let``` was introduced in ES6 and is blocked-scoped, making it preferable over ```var``` in many cases. It allows for reassignment, but not redeclaration.
- ```const``` is also introduced in ES6 and is block-scoped like let, but it cannot be reassigned once a value is assigned.
